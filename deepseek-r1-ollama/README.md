>>> In a group of 100 people, each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. How many handshak
... es occur?
<think>
Okay, so there's this problem where we have 100 people, and each person shakes hands with every other 
person exactly once. We need to find out how many handshakes happen in total.

Alright, let me think about this step by step. If I consider one person, say Person A, they will shake hands with everyone 
else in the group. Since there are 100 people in total, Person A would shake hands with 99 others. So that's 99 handshakes 
right there.

But wait, if I do this for every person, that means each of the 100 people is shaking hands with 99 others. So at first 
glance, it might seem like there are 100 multiplied by 99 handshakes. Let me calculate that: 100 * 99 equals 9900.

Hold on a second though. If I count it this way, am I counting each handshake twice? Because when Person A shakes hands 
with Person B, that's one unique handshake, but in my calculation above, both Person A and Person B are counted separately 
shaking hands with each other. So essentially, the same handshake is being counted once for each participant.

That means if I simply multiply 100 by 99, I'm actually double-counting all the handshakes. To get the correct number of 
unique handshakes, I need to divide that initial total by 2. So that would be 9900 divided by 2, which equals 4950.

Therefore, there are a total of 4950 unique handshakes when each person in a group of 100 shakes hands with every other 
person exactly once.

To determine the number of unique handshakes in a group of 100 people where each person shakes hands with every other 
person exactly once, we can use combinatorial mathematics.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each handshake involves two distinct individuals.
   - We need to count how many unique pairs can be formed from 100 people.

2. **Using Combinations:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 100 is given by the combination formula:
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
     where \( n = 100 \) and \( k = 2 \).

3. **Calculating the Combination:**
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     C(100, 2) = \frac{100!}{2!(100-2)!} = \frac{100 \times 99 \times 98!}{2 \times 1 \times 98!} 
     \]
   - Simplifying the factorials:
     \[
     C(100, 2) = \frac{100 \times 99}{2} = \frac{9900}{2} = 4950
     \]

**Final Answer:**

There are a total of **4,950 unique handshakes** in the group.[GIN] 2025/01/27 - 03:20:14 | 200 |         1m21s |       127.0.0.1 | POST     "/api/chat"
